## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  The super learner article was soothing to read.  I feel connected to reading a lot, seeing learning as a process, having a growth mindset and consciously taking care of my brain.  I liked learning how to improve or add other characteristics. I haven't been sitting with my notebook, my kitten or a teammate to teach what I have been learning.  I know it would help and I intend to add practice.  I have a tendency to ride a hot-streak of accomplishing tasks with no breaks.  I will be sticking to some kind of break-taking method going forward.

  I did not see sleep in the brain care section.  I am 1000% better with a solid nights sleep, almost a different human.  As we shift out of evening-class mode, I know my body will get back to the sunrise, sunset circadian rhythm it needs.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  Most primitive scripts used to instruct computer, that the browser decides to use:
  *Numbers: integers (positive or negative), floating point numbers (such as decimals)
  *Strings: letter, text, number, special characters wrapped in "" or ''
  *Booleans: is a result of a comparison; it is shown as True or False

  However we also learned about the internal mathmatical representation of a string, and its algorithmic value, Comparing strings, that there is a function to help maintain consistency across different countries and their native tongues.  There were so many fun and weird worm holes.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

    console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  //Two forward slashes are the characters to indicate code comments on one line in a JavaScript file.
  /*Indicates the use of more than one code comment line.  The purpose of a code comment is to facilitate text communication with explicit and efficient detail with other developers.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  *A variable is stored data of any type so java script can communicate.  It can change or vary.  It is calculated, announced and assigned.

  *A variable is how you say what you're about to talk about. It can change. It helps figure things out.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  **PostMates**

  * var login
  * var favorites
  * var restaurant

  The variable for login holds a *concatenation* of calculation of password and name matching (i think). Then this could be a *boolean*, perhaps.  Did I get my password right, no. Denied entry.  This seems like a boolean and a concatenation.

  The variable favorites calculates the *number* of times I order tacos divided by the total number of orders I place and sees I order tacos the most and generates an array.

  The variable restaurant is a simple *string*.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  To concatenate is to join together, yolk, marry, strings with each other.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

  I started a discussion with myself in answer 6 on concatenation as a point of sale login opportunity on any site. However, let me get specific.  A dating website. That definitely has to join together ages, ideologies, interests and personalities as an overall representation of concatenation.  Though a specific moment a developer makes use of concatenation seems like the moment someone has to enter their catch phrases.  On the user side the data is entered then When it comes out of the computer blender it looks beautifully organized/strung together.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS!
=========================

What did I do to make it so that when i type git add i have to enter the ENTIRE path rather than just the one file or directory I want to add? Why do I have to put the file i want to add in quotes or else I get an error message? 

I got errors on the homework in places my syntax was bogus.  I just played with it until it showed me what i wanted it see.

Trial and error is the way through this, right?

I feel that with references I can do this homework.  It seems like Turing will stick elucidate which methods work best for each of us to open up and learn and retain and relearn information.  I keep asking for reading resources because it helps me for some reason to pick up a book and research and read what I have been researching and reading on line.  I have Eloquent JavaSript and JavaScript and jQuery.  

Are there other books that it would behoove me to invest in or should I stick with what I have?

I feel I will have more specific questions about the work, the more I realize what I don't know.  With this assignment there was a lot of deduction based work that if I scrolled up on the examples I could tease apart.  

 I know I don't have this memorized.  If tested I may not at this be able to recall what I answered here.
