## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * Taking a challenge head on is something that resonates.

  * You can always learn anything, as long as you want to learn it. (I was thrilled to hear!)

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  *  I am an incredibly resilient human, enjoy learning, have the want to understand this material

  *  I'm also shedding the last remnants of a fear-based approach to learning by tracking my own learning and believing, even on the hard days, that tomorrow will be better.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  *  I use my music app every day.  Music apps are lists within lists within lists.  They have to be the ultimate concateny of variables .splices and .lengths and .shifts.

  *  *example*: As soon as the app opens the UI deviates into list choices

              ```
               var mainScreen = ["Browse", "Library", "For You"];

                ```
               Each of those arrays has with in it arrays as well

                ```
               var library = ["Playlists", "Artists", "Albums"];

               ```

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  * An Array Method: is doing something to an array; it takes into account or changes items across a list, and the way its written elicits a sought after return.


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  *  A loop is a time saver and efficiency maker.  We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we wanted to iterate into or across an array by writing across or calculating for individual pieces of a given array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  *  You know how in dance class, sometimes the teacher wants you to do some of the steps she told you at the beginning of class, but then later during class, she wants you to add a step or two, so she can see you perform them together?  Thats a loop.  

  *  A loop is used when you want to write information (numbers, words, symbols) into an already existing list of information and see the results, if given a set of circumstances, you could.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  *  Are there more loop-specific methods that we learn later at Turing or are loops in arrays similar to functions (as we've learned them) in that theres a specifically ordered and called together syntax that gets us the return we are looking for?
