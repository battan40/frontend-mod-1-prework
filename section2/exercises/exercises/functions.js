//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.
function sayHello () {
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
};

sayHello();
sayHello();
//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.
function greetMe(name, nickName, stageName) {
  console.log("hello, my name is " + name + " but you can call me " + nickName + " and I used to go by " + stageName);
}
greetMe('Angela', 'Angie', 'Diana');
greetMe('Ana', 'Izzy', 'Isabella');
greetMe('Arlene', 'Pickles', 'Harley');

// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.
function totalBooks(floorBooks, cabinetBooks) {
  console.log(floorBooks + cabinetBooks);
}
totalBooks(101, 18);
totalBooks(133, 77);

// YOU DOðŸŽˆ: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.
function kittens(litterMate1, litterMate2) {
  console.log(litterMate1 + " and " + litterMate2 + " are family for life.")
}

kittens('Selah', 'Moriah')

//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?

EXPLAIN:I named the function kittens because it is fast to type in by comparison to other names
I was considering. The parameters I chose to highlight that my kittens are twins.
So, I named the parameters litterMate1 and litterMate2.
