## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I *love* asking questions privately, but haven't found my voice in a group, with consistency. I wait too long, until i've gone down too many internet rabbit holes. Then when I do ask I word vomit with a lack of concise purpose.  I have a friend that lets me text rubber ducky moments all day long, which has been fantastic!
**the section on what to do to make good use of the questions as they arise, how to organize the process of weighing out when to ask and how to ask, was gold.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
That part wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.  I realized i've been taking detailed notes.  That part went as smoothly as it could go.  I still have a lot of room to grow but I know the pathway to my clean terminal tree.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement takes evaluating variable comparison to the next level. Basically, a conditional statement is a way of writing script thats based on this idea: if an evaluation turns out to be true, then the code that goes into play is the one thats stated or else the code goes in another direction.
**Example**
facebook messenger app; Probably has a conditional statement regarding if I read a message, then the photo icon drops down arguing that I have read the message, else I reset my messenger to away before I read.
**Real Life Example**
If my cat scratches my office chair, then my office chair looks horrible, else I buy the tape that makes cats not want to scratch furniture.


4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
When I am trying to get a code to run, the if statement and the logical operators help me especially when I'm trying to add multiple conditions.  

If a condition and another condition held together by the logical operator "&&" yields (evaluates) a value that comes back as correct/true, then the code I want to declare can run.  Otherwise, another condition can be looked at with the same test.  If it comes back as correct then it runs, then onto the next line.  If it doesn't run then there is a way to set up a failsafe for errors and responses unexpected by setting up another condition and running through the same process.


5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical Operators, Booleans, the itiration of the if/then/else  process, then the devil is in the details.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I don't have this section memorized.  I will  need to put functions and conditions into practice more in codecadamy to drum up more questions.  

Why did the final line of code in comparisons.js come back as an integer and not a Boolean?  I know there are nuances that I get to learn from here, but I thought I understood that the integer would be returned as a boolean.
